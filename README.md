Problem Statement:
The problem statement of a website that allows users to search for movies using APIs and is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface that can quickly and accurately retrieve movie data from the chosen API and display it in a visually appealing way to the user.

Some key considerations to address include:

Search functionality: The website should have a search bar where users can enter a movie title or keyword and get relevant results quickly and accurately.

API integration: The JavaScript code needs to be able to communicate with the chosen API, retrieve the requested data, and parse it correctly to display it on the website.

User interface: The website should have a clean and intuitive design that allows users to easily find and select the movie they are interested in, and display the movie data in a visually appealing and understandable way.

Performance: The website should be optimized to ensure fast load times and minimal delays when retrieving and displaying movie data.

Compatibility: The website should be compatible with a range of devices, browsers, and screen sizes, to ensure that it is accessible to as many users as possible.

By addressing these key considerations, the website can provide an effective solution to the problem of helping users search for and discover new movies using API data, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Objective :
The objective of a movie search website built using API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is to provide a user-friendly platform for movie lovers to search for and discover new movies quickly and easily. The website's primary objective is to retrieve relevant movie data from one or more movie databases using API calls and then present this data in a visually appealing and easily understandable way to users.

Some specific objectives of such a website could include:

Making it easy for users to search for movies based on title, keyword, genre, or other criteria.

Providing comprehensive and accurate information about each movie, such as its release date, cast, ratings, reviews, and trailers.

Offering personalized recommendations to users based on their search history or preferences.

Allowing users to create lists of their favorite movies, rate and review movies they have seen, and share their movie-related content with others.

Providing a seamless and enjoyable user experience across different devices and platforms, including desktops, mobile devices, and tablets.

Overall, the objective of a movie search website is to make it easier for users to find and explore the vast world of movies, while also providing them with a platform to share their thoughts and experiences with others.

Methodology:
The methodology of building a movie search website using API, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS involves several key steps:

Choose an API: Select one or more movie databases with a relevant API that provides the necessary information, such as title, cast, rating, synopsis, and posters, and register for an API key if required.

Plan the website: Decide on the website's structure and user interface, including the search bar, search results page, movie details page, and any additional features such as personal lists or recommendations.

Develop the HTML structure: Create the basic structure of the website using HTML, including the search bar, navigation, and placeholders for the search results and movie details.

Write the JavaScript code: Use JavaScript to interact with the API, retrieve the requested data, and display it on the web page dynamically. This includes handling user input, making API calls, and parsing the retrieved data.

Style the website using CSS: Add visual styles and layouts to the website, including fonts, colors, backgrounds, and responsive design to make it accessible on a range of devices.

Test and refine the website: Test the website thoroughly, including search functionality, API integration, responsiveness, and user experience, and refine it based on user feedback and usage analytics.

Deploy and maintain the website: Publish the website on a web hosting platform or server, and maintain it regularly with updates, bug fixes, and new features.

Overall, the methodology of building a movie search website involves combining the power of APIs with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an engaging and user-friendly platform that allows movie lovers to explore and discover new movies.

Proposed Work:
A website that allows users to search for movies using APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) and is built using HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript is a web application that retrieves data from one or more movie databases, such as OMDB or The Movie DB, and displays the results to the user.

The website usually consists of a search bar where users can enter a movie title or keyword, and then the JavaScript code sends a request to the API and retrieves the matching movies' data. The HTML and CSS are then used to format and display the results on the web page, often including movie posters, summaries, ratings, and other information.

Such websites are commonly used to help users discover new movies, find information about their favorite films, and make decisions about what to watch next. They rely on the APIs for data and the frontend technologies for user interface and interactivity.
